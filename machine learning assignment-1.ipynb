    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.\n",
    "These systems are designed to simulate human cognitive abilities, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI can be categorized into two types: Narrow AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks, and General AI, which aims to exhibit human-level intelligence across a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An example of AI is a virtual personal assistant like Siri or Google Assistant. These assistants can understand natural language, answer questions, perform tasks, and provide recommendations based on user preferences. \n",
